<h1>W3C HTML Validation Service: To Do List</h1>

<p>
  This page has the to-do list for the <a href="/">W3C
  HTML Validation Service</a>, including bugs that need fixing and general
  wishlist items.
</p>

<p>
  See also: <a
  href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-validator/">www-validator
  mailing list archives</a> for recent discussion that may not be reflected
  on this page.
</p>

<p>
  These items are roughly in prioritized order; i.e. the items near the
  top are those which I consider most important.
</p>

<ol>

  <li> put error explanations online, re-link them from validator
    output

  <li> apply <a
    href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-validator/2000JulSep/0146.html">Takuya's
    XML encoding patch</a>; merge in <a
    href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-validator/2000JulSep/0095.html">Terje's
    cleanup patch</a>

  <li> bug fix: <a
   href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A//www.w3.org/2001/01/xml-latin1.html;ss">this
   doc</a> is invalid, but not reported as such

  <li> don't output a bazillion errors for documents with bogus
    FPIs (see <a
    href="/check?uri=http://validator.w3.org/dev/tests/bogus-fpi.html">a
    sample</a>)

  <li> add a doctype-overriding option (use <a
    href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-validator/2000OctDec/0037.html">Terje's
    patch</a>

  <li> add a textarea for testing short HTML fragments

  <li> add a "fix my HTML for me" option using <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/">tidy</a>.

  <li> finish adding support for XML validation (see also: <a
    href="dev/tests/#xml">test cases</a>, or <a
    href="http://www.hcrc.ed.ac.uk/~richard/xml-check.html">an
    existing service</a>)

  <li> update <a
    href="http://validator.w3.org/sgml-lib.tar.gz">sgml-lib.tar.gz</a>;
    automate the updates

  <li> always display source code if there are errors?
    (or maybe just show a few lines of context for each error?)
    Or add a "show source iff errors" option?

  <li> allow twiddling of options from the results page

  <li> make lists of "most frequently validated invalid pages"
    and "most frequently validated (non-W3C?) valid pages"
    (need to start logging stuff first, including IPs to compare
    uniqueness)

  <li> create a stylesheet and link to it from every page

  <li> add a section to the report on <a
  href="http://www.mnot.net/cacheability/">document
  cacheability</a>? (or just link to it?)

  <li> put the explanations in a database (flat files are probably okay),
    offer an option to display them inline with the errors

  <li> add support for more character encodings

  <li> install and play with HTML::Validator, link to it from somewhere:
    <a href="http://www.hut.fi/~samzait/HTML-Validator/">http://www.hut.fi/~samzait/HTML-Validator/</a> 
    <a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-authors/id/S/SA/SAIT/">http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-authors/id/S/SA/SAIT/</a>

  <li> write documentation, describing each
    feature and option of the validator and answering questions like
    "What's the difference between an SGML parser and Weblint?",
    "Which DOCTYPE should I use?",
    content negotiation,
    ...

  <li> upgrade <a href="http://www.weblint.org/">weblint</a> to
  the most recent version

  <li> incorporate <a
  href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-validator/1999AprJun/0003.html">patches</a>
  to make it work on win9x systems

  <li> incorporate CSS validation directly into this service

  <li> make e.g.
    <code>http://validator.w3.org/check/referer;imgonly</code>
    return only an image showing the validation status of the referring page

  <li> add link validation using Hugo's <a
  href="http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/validator/httpd/cgi-bin/checklink.pl">checklink
  code</a>
  (or other code with similar functionality)

  <li> give errors/warnings related to markup that is technically
  valid SGML, but error prone, such as things found in <a
  href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/appendix/notes.html#h-B.3">"B.3
  SGML implementation notes"</a> in the <a
  href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/">HTML 4.0 spec</a>.
  (these things really belong in <a
  href="http://www.weblint.org/">weblint</a>; does it handle
  any/all of them?)

  <li> make an "elements found" section a la Webtechs, with links from each
    element to the appropriate place in either the DTD tree listing produced
    with dtd2html (after running dtd2html with all DTDs in the catalog),
    or the HTML 3.2/4.0 specs, or htmlhelp.com stuff, ...
    Similarly, put links on each element in the parse tree.

  <li> add a "document meta-information" section to the report, to encourage
    people to use META tags appropriately?

  <li> add a "recommend a DTD for me" feature (check a document against all
    available DTDs, report which one has the fewest errors)

  <li> start caching validation results locally and doing an If-Modified-Since
    HTTP request to only download and re-validate URLs if they actually
    changed since their last validation

  <li> site walker/validator:
    need to add a "registered user" feature first, because this feature
    could be abused (many requests on a server in a short period of time)?

  <li> URL-minder service: "remind me if this page or set of pages ever
      ceases to validate"
  <ul>
    <li> "registered user" feature is also necessary for this (to prevent
      unwanted e-mail)
    <li> "registered users" could have a list of URLs they're interested in,
      and whenever they return to the service they can modify this list,
      and e-mail can be sent whenever any of them cease to validate
    <li> right now someone could probably use the existing URL-minder service
      instead of writing a new one (tell it to "mind" the URL that points to the
      validation result for a page?) But I'm not sure how regularly URL-minder
      checks for changes; it seemed to be weekly or something, which isn't
      frequent enough, IMO. Doing an If-Modified-Since GET every day doesn't
      cost much if pages don't change. Some of these features should only
      be enabled if the page consistently returns a Last-Modified header, maybe.
  </ul>

  <li> add an HTML pretty-printer feature, using <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/">tidy</a>?

  <li> provide messages in different languages?

  <li> add a graphical representation of the document's structure,
    using GIFs-mixed-with-text, or an entire GIF?

  <li> add a section with PICS info?

  <li> issue PICS labels for documents that do/don't conform?
    or for editing tools that don't conform?

</ol>
