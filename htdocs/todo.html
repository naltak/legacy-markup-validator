  <h2>W3C Markup Validator Roadmap</h2>
  
  
    <p id="skip" class="intro">
      This page holds the development roadmap for the <a href="./"><acronym
        title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</acronym> Markup
        Validation Service</a>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>For a list open bugs and detailed feature, we now use
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/">Bugzilla</a>, which can be searched 
      by specific milestone version numbers.</li>
      <li>This roadmap only gives a high-level overview of what each generation of the
        validator changed from the others. 
        For a detailed list of features and changes in past releases, see the
        <a href="whatsnew.html">News</a> page.</li>
      <li>If you would like to discuss this roadmap, or request new features, please join the
      <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-validator/">www-validator
        mailing list</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Past Releases Roadmap</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>Versions Prior to 0.6.0</dt>
      <dd>Versioning up to version 0.5.x was only done as a development mechanism, and 
        the validator was not following a strict release cycle.</dd>
      <dt>0.6.x</dt>
      <dd>The 0.6.0 release, in 2002, kicked in a new phase of open source development for the validator, 
        including a number of bug fixes. 0.6.0 through 0.6.7 included mostly bug fixes and documentation updates.</dd>
      <dt>0.7.x</dt>
      <dd>The 0.7.0 release reorganized the validator to use templates, making it easier to produce different outputs (hence the development of an API). 0.7.0 through 0.7.4 included mostly bug fixes and documentation updates.</dd>
      <dt>0.8.x</dt>
      <dd>The 0.8.0 release sees the validator code reorganized around a more modular architecture, adding better XML checking capabilities.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Future Roadmap</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>0.9.x</dt>
      <dd>The next big version of the validator should be about localization. Provide at least all the error messages to users in their languages, and if possible, UI and documentation as well. Other things that could make it to 0.9.x:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Start caching validation results locally and doing an
          <code>If-Modified-Since</code>
          <acronym title="HyperText Transfer Protocol">HTTP</acronym>
          request to only download and revalidate
          <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locators">URLs</acronym>
          if they actually changed since their last validation
        </li>
        <li>
          Site walker/validator: need to add a "registered user" feature first,
          because this feature could be abused (many requests on a server in a
          short period of time)?
        </li>
        <li>
          <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym>-minder service:
          "remind me if this page or set of pages ever ceases to validate".
        </li>
       </ul>
      </dd>
      <dt>1.0</dt>
      <dd>This is often seen as "blue sky". This version should build upon a modular structure, and
        be able to use different parsers as alternates or in sequence: support relaxNG, schematron, etc. 
        Also, investigate checking of <a
          href="http://www.openhealth.org/RDDL/"><acronym
            title="Resource Directory Description Language">RDDL</acronym></a>, microformats and other rich markup.
        </dd>
    
    </dl>
    
    <h3>Miscellaneous things that should get into this roadmap</h3>
     
      <ul>
        <li>
          Add a section to the report on
          <a href="http://www.mnot.net/cacheability/">document cacheability</a>?
          (or just link to it?)
        </li>
        <li>
          Make e.g. <code>http://validator.w3.org/check/referer;imgonly</code>
          return only an image showing the validation status of the referring
          page, or something similar with a landing page for referer validation,
          showcasing what validation/web conformance/standards are, with most 
          of the gritty stuff hidden from view.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make an "elements found" section a la Webtechs, with links from each
          element to the appropriate place in either the <acronym
            title="Document Type Definition">DTD</acronym> tree listing
          produced with dtd2html (after running dtd2html with all <acronym
          title="Document Type Definitions">DTDs</acronym> in the
          catalog), or the <acronym title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</acronym>
          3.2/4.0 specs, or htmlhelp.com stuff, ...
        </li>
        <li>
          Add a "recommend a <acronym title="Document Type Definition">DTD</acronym>
          for me" feature (check a document against all
          available DTDs, report which one has the fewest errors)
        </li>
</ul>
