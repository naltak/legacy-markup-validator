    <h4>Other installation guides</h4>
    <p>The installation guide we provide here is a rather generic set of instructions, 
    which should work on most systems. To our knowledge, the following platform-specific 
    guides are also available and can be of interest :</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://developer.apple.com/internet/opensource/validator.html">Mac OS X and OS X Server</a>
        at the Apple Developer Connection,</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.mediaville.net/articles/validator/">Mac OS X and OS X Server</a>
        by Stephen Yoch,</li>
        <li><a href="install_win.html">Windows</a>, by David Tibbe</li>
        <li><a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-validator/2003Dec/0023.html">Linux (Slackware)</a>
        by Nick Talbott</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Related documentation</h4>
    <p>This installation guides presumes knowledge of the <a href="../source/">Source availability</a> for the
    Markup Validator.</p>
    <p>We recommend that <a href="devel.html">developers</a> wishing to contribute on the Markup Validator or modify it
    go through this installation procedure once, to get familiar with the system.</p>

    <h3 id="install-package">Installing on packaged systems</h3>
    
    <p>The easiest way to install released versions of the Markup Validator is to use the packages created
    for some platforms by contributors: Debian GNU/Linux and Fedora Core packages are 
    <a href="../source/">available</a>.</p>
    
    <h3 id="install-fromsource">Installing from source (generic case)</h3>
    <p>These instructions are strongly inspired from Nick Talbott's guide for Slackware Linux. Thanks Nick!</p>
    <h4><a id="install-download" name="install-download"></a>Download</h4>
        <p>Download the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/validator.tar.gz">Validator's Tar Ball</a>
        and the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/sgml-lib.tar.gz">DTD library</a> from our site.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, if you want to work on the latest development version, you can download 
        both from our CVS repository, but you should be aware that this version may not work at all.</p>
        <p>(<a href="../source/">Read more</a> about retrieving the source)</p>

    <h4><a id="install-prereq" name="install-prereq"></a>Prerequisites</h4>

     <p>
        Apart from a properly configured Web server, the Validator needs a
        SGML parser -- that does all the hard work --, Perl (version 5.8.0
        or newer) and several Perl modules used by the "check" CGI script.
      </p>
     <h5 id="install-prereq-sp">OpenSP, the SGML (and XML) parser</h5>
      <p>
        The SGML parser we're currently using is <code>OpenSP 1.5.2</code>,
        which can be found on the
        <a href="http://openjade.sourceforge.net/">OpenJade home page</a>.
        Do <em>not</em> try to run the Validator with an earlier than 1.5
        version of OpenSP.  It will not work.  If one hacks it to "work"
        with such a version, a potential security hole will also open.
        Just use OpenSP 1.5 or later.
      </p>

      <h5  id="install-prereq-perl">Perl Modules</h5>
      <p>
        The canonical list of Perl modules we use can be found in the source
        for the "check" CGI script. There is a bunch of lines that of the form
        "use Foo::Bar" where each "Foo::Bar" represents a module. Most modules
        can be found on <a href="http://www.cpan.org/"><acronym
            title="Comprehensive Perl Archive Network">CPAN</acronym></a>
        (minimum versions in parenthesis after the name). The following
        list was complete when CVS spit out:
        <code>$Date: 2007-04-04 03:50:19 $</code>. <tt>:-)</tt>
      </p>
     <p>
       One easy - and strongly recommended - way to take care of all these
       Perl module dependencies is to install
       <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Bundle-W3C-Validator/">Bundle-W3C-Validator</a>
       from CPAN.  See the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Bundle-W3C-Validator/lib/Bundle/W3C/Validator.pm">documentation included with it</a>
       for more details.
     </p>
     
     <p>The only current exception is SGML::Parser::OpenSP, for which at this point in time the development version
     of the validator requires a not-yet-released version, which can be downloaded and installed 
     from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/spo">SourceForge</a>. First make sure to have 
     <a href="#install-prereq-sp">OpenSP</a> installed, then get 
     <a href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=106431">the latest revision of the source code for SGML::Parser::OpenSP</a> from CVS, 
     and follow these installation steps, as root:</p>
     <ul>
       <li>perl Makefile.PL</li>
       <li>make</li>
       <li>make test</li>
       <li>make install</li>
     </ul>
     
     <p>This should give you a working SGML::Parser::OpenSP. Just then proceed to install the other required perl modules through CPAN.</p>

          version.  Validator's support for compressed responses is available
          with version 5.802 and later.  If you want your Validator to
          support <abbr title="Secure Sockets Layer">SSL</abbr>/<abbr

     <h5>List of optional Perl module distributions</h5>

      <p>
        The perl modules listed below are optional; the validator will use
        them to provide some extra functionality if they're available.
      </p>

    <h4><a id="install-components" name="install-components"></a>Install the various necessary components:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><p>The installation guide assumes that you have a working Web server. We suggest
            the popular Apache server, which is used for the W3C Markup Validation service. 
            The validator may work with other Web servers than the popular Apache, but
            we can not guarantee that it will. You will also need a working installation 
            of the Perl language (standard on most Web servers).</p></li>
                
            <li><p>Proceed with the  Prerequisites, as detailed above.</p></li>
                
            <li><p>Create a directory for the validator's installation. On Unix-based systems, 
            the default will be <code>/usr/local/validator</code>. This
            directory will be referred to as <code>[validatorpath]</code>
            throughout this guide.</p></li>
                
            <li>
              <p>
                Unpack the archives of the validator and DTD library into a
                temporary directory, and copy the directories
                <code>htdocs</code>, <code>httpd/cgi-bin</code>, and
                <code>share</code> from <code>validator-<em>X.X.X</em></code>
                into <code>[validatorpath]</code>.
              </p>
              <p>
                The <code>[validatorpath]</code> directory should now have
                subdirectories named <code>cgi-bin</code>, <code>htdocs</code>,
                and and <code>share</code>.
              </p>
            </li>

    <h4><a id="install-configure" name="install-configure"></a>Configure</h4>
	<h5>Configuration files</h5>

      <p>
	For reference, here is an overview of all the configuration files for
	the Markup Validator.
      </p>

      <p>
        The validator uses a number of configuration files -- most of which
        are really mapping tables of some form -- to avoid having to check in
        a new version of the code every time a new version of HTML comes out.
        All configuration files can be found in
        <code>htdocs/config/</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To really understand what each does you should read the source, but
        here is a short description to get you started.
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>validator.conf</dt>
        <dd>
          The validator's <strong>main configuration file</strong>. This will
          generally be the only file you need to edit. It sets various parameters, such as:
          the address of the maintainer, the URL for the "Home Page", various file paths and locations,
          whether the <a href="api.html">API</a> is enabled, etc.
        </dd>
        <dt>charset.cfg</dt>
        <dd>
          Maps character sets to conversion parameters for validator's
          internal UTF-8 conversion.
        </dd>
        <dt>eref.cfg</dt>
        <dd>
          Contains the mappings from element names to a URL path
          (relative to a configurable URL) for their definitions. Used
          in output when the "Show Parse Tree" option is enabled.
        </dd>
        <dt>types.conf</dt>
        <dd>
          Maps MIME/HTTP Content-Types to an internal "document type" which
          is used for treating HTML, XML, and XHTML in different ways.
        </dd>
       </dl>



	<h5>Configure the Web server</h5>
	<p>The following instructions are for the Apache Web server, and should be adapted 
	if you plan on using another server.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                Edit the configuration of your Web server to refer to the
                specific configuration file for the validator.
              </p>
              <p>
                This can be done by inserting the contents of the
                <code>httpd/conf/httpd.conf</code> file (from where you
                unpacked the validator's tarball above) in your
                <code>httpd.conf</code>, or by copying the file somewhere
                and including it like:
              </p>
              <pre>Include /where/you/copied/it/httpd.conf</pre>
              <p>
                Then, start editing the validator specific part.
              </p>
            </li>
            
            <li><p>You may want to set up a "virtual server" for the service. This can be done
            by adding something similar to the following :</p>
<pre>&lt;VirtualHost 127.0.0.1&gt;                                                               
	DocumentRoot [validatorpath]/htdocs/                        
	ServerName validator.example.org
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</pre>
            <p><strong>AND/OR</strong> you may want to have the service at a specific location
            on your Web server, which can be configured as follows :</p>
            <pre>Alias /validator/ [validatorpath]/htdocs/</pre>
            </li>
                
            <li><p>Finish editing this HTTP server configuration file, adapting 
            all the directory references to reflect the paths used in your installation.</p></li>
                
            <li><p>Now restart the Web server to activate the updated configuration.</p><p> For Apache
            this is done by typing into a shell, as System Administrator: 
            <code>apachectl graceful</code> (or, for older versions of Apache 
            <code>apachectl configtest</code> then <code>apachectl restart</code>)</p></li>
       </ol>

    <h5>Configure the Validator itself</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Create the directory <code>/etc/w3c</code> and copy a the files
            from <code>[validatorpath]/htdocs/config/</code> to it.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Edit <code>/etc/w3c/validator.conf</code> to reflect where files
            are in your installation, and configure other parameters there as
            you wish.  This file is well commented and modifying it should be
            relatively straightforward.
          </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4><a id="install-check" name="install-check"></a>Check the installation</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Point your browser at the new site.</p></li> 
        <li><p>Check the error log of the Web server to get clues on what may be wrong 
        if you get any server errors.</p></li>
   </ol>

   <h3 id="install-troubleshoot">Troubleshooting a new installation</h3>
   <p>It is not always easy to troubleshoot an incomplete, or failed, installation of
   the Markup Validator. While the instructions given in this page should help most people
   install the validator successfully on their system, bad luck, a forgotten step 
    or a broken component can make things go sour.</p>

   <h4>Double check the installation steps</h4>
   <p>The first sound thing to do if the installation failed would be to check that you did not forget
   any step while installing. properly copying and editing the configuration file is among the common
   mistakes, for example.</p>

   <h4>Check the logs</h4>
   <p>The error logs for your Web server should be a good first place to look for hints on what
   is wrong with your installation.</p>

   <h4>Check the dependencies</h4>
   <p>A common problem with a newly installed validator is a validator that is apparently running
   but marking anything as "invalid", without giving any error message as output.</p>

  <p>This is somewhat typical of a problem with OpenSP. Cross-check that you actually have a version
  above 1.5, by running <kbd>onsgmls --version</kbd>.</p>   


   <h4>The miracle debug options</h4>
   <p>If the validator is misbehaving, you can try forcing various debug options by appending to
   the URL the following string: <kbd>&amp;debug=1&amp;errors=1&amp;esis=1&amp;verbose=1</kbd></p>

   <p>This can sometimes provide you with error messages that would not have appeared anywhere in
   non-debug mode, and can be helpful to diagnose the problem</p>

   <h4>If all fails...</h4>
   <p>Don't hesitate to contact the public mailing-list www-validator@w3.org with all the details 
  you can provide on what you did, tried, and what went wrong...</p>

    <h3 id="post-install">Post-install options</h3>
   <p>if the installation succeeded, you should be able to now use the Markup Validator on your own
   system and network. You may want to give the validator a look and feel specific to your Web site.
   The easiest way to achieve this is to edit <code>header.html</code> and <code>footer.html</code>
   (in the <code>htdocs</code> directory), the header and footer markup snippets used to build all 
   pages for the validator.</p><p>  You may also edit the Style Sheets (in the same directory), 
   especially <code>base.css</code> You may however want to avoid editing the other CSS files too 
   heavily, there is a risk you could make the output of the validator unusable.</p>
