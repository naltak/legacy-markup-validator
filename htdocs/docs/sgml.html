      <h2 id="sgml">What is SGML?</h2>
      <p>
        SGML stands for Standard Generalized Markup Language. This is
        actually a slight misnomer, since SGML is actually a
        <em>meta-language</em> &mdash; that is, a language for writing markup
        languages.  HTML is a markup language written in SGML &mdash; an "SGML
        application", to use the terminology.
      </p>
      <p>
        You don't actually have to know much about SGML to use The Validator
        successfully. If you're interested, though, I recommend TEI's
        <a href="http://etext.virginia.edu/tei-tocs1.html">"A Gentle
        Introduction to SGML"</a> as a good starting point. An additional SGML
        resource can be found on
        <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/cover/sgml-xml.html">SIL's SGML
        Web Page</a>.

    </div>

    <div>
      <h2 id="dtd">What is a DTD?</h2>
      <p>
        For our purposes, a DTD, or Document Type Definition, is simply a file
        that defines the syntax of a <a href="#sgml">SGML</a>-based language.
        The DTD's for
        <a href="http://w3.org/MarkUp/html-spec/">HTML 2.0</a>
        and <a href="http://w3.org/TR/REC-html32">HTML 3.2</a>
        were written by the HTML Working Group of the
        <a href="http://www.ietf.org/"><abbr title="Internet Engineering Task Force">IETF</abbr></a>,
        in collaboration with the <a href="http://w3.org"><abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr></a>.
        From <a href="http://w3.org/TR/html4">HTML 4.0</a> on (this includes
        <a href="http://w3.org/TR/xhtml1">XHTML</a>), the standards (both
        prose and DTDs) have been written by the
        <a href="http://w3.org"><abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr></a>.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2 id="doctype">What is this <code>DOCTYPE</code> thing The Validator
        keeps pestering me for?</h2>

      <p>
        A <code>DOCTYPE</code> is a <a href="#sgml">SGML</a> document type
        declaration. Its purpose is to tell an SGML parser what
        <a href="#dtd">DTD</a> it should use to parse the document. It appears
        as the first line of the document, and has the form:
        <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "quoted string"&gt;</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        The quoted string is called a <dfn>public identifier</dfn>; it refers
        to the desired DTD by a "well-known" name, usually defined by an
        associated standard.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most Web browsers don't actually use an SGML parser (in fact, none
        that I'm aware of do), and so they don't need a <code>DOCTYPE</code>
        declaration, and will ignore it if present. The Validator, however,
        does use an SGML parser, and therefore needs a <code>DOCTYPE</code>
        declaration. The Validator is more insistent on this point than
        WebTechs was, which would insert a <code>DOCTYPE</code> on the fly
        for you; The Validator requires that your <code>DOCTYPE</code> already
        be in the document.
      </p>
      <p>
        So now you're preparing to add a <code>DOCTYPE</code> to your document.
        Be sure that the syntax is as described above, and that you use the
        correct public identifier; otherwise, The Validator will use the wrong
        DTD, or will be unable to find a DTD at all, and will produce a huge
        list of absolutely meaningless errors. The Validator's
        <a href="catalog">public identifier catalog</a> lists all the public
        identifiers The Validator recognizes for various types of HTML; of
        those, the following public identifiers are most likely to be widely
        recognized:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt><code>For HTML 2.0...</code></dt><dd>...use "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN"</dd>
        <dt><code>For HTML 4.0...</code></dt><dd>...use "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0//EN"</dd>
        <dt><code>For HTML 4.0 Transitional...</code></dt><dd>...use "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN"</dd>
        <dt><code>For HTML 4.0 Frameset...</code></dt><dd>...use "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Framset//EN"</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>Note that the string must appear exactly as shown, including case.</p>
      <p class="warning">
        <strong>WARNING:</strong></a> Some HTML editors will insert a
        <code>DOCTYPE</code> declaration for you. Unfortunately, this
        pre-inserted <code>DOCTYPE</code> will sometimes confuse
        The Validator. This usually occurs when the inserted
        <code>DOCTYPE</code> does not correspond to the generated HTML.
        If your editor adds a <code>DOCTYPE</code> to your page, you may
        need to correct it as described above before running your page through
        The Validator.
