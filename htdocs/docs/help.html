<h2 id=#about">About the Markup Validator</h2>
      <h3 id="what-is-it">What is the Markup Validator and what does it do?</h3>
      <p>
	The Markup Validator is a free tool and service that checks the 
	syntax of (X)HTML documents.</p> 
      <p>
	The Validator is sort of like <code>lint</code> for C. It compares
        your HTML document to the defined syntax of HTML and reports any
        discrepancies. 
      </p>
      <p><a href="../about.html">Learn more</a> about the Markup Validator.</p>

      <h3 id="why-validate">Why should I validate my HTML pages?</h3>
      <p>
        One of the important maxims of computer programming is: <q>Be
        conservative in what you produce; be liberal in what you accept.</q>
      </p>
      <p>
        Browsers follow the second half of this maxim by accepting Web pages
        and trying to display them even if they're not legal HTML. Usually
        this means that the browser will try to make educated guesses about
        what you probably meant. The problem is that different browsers (or
        even different versions of the same browser) will make different
        guesses about the same illegal construct; worse, if your HTML is
        <em>really</em> pathological, the browser could get hopelessly
        confused and produce a mangled mess, or even crash.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's why you want to follow the first half of the maxim by making
        sure your pages are legal HTML. The best way to do that is by
        running your documents through one or more HTML validators. 
      </p>
      
      <h3 id="others">What other validators are there?</h3>
	<p>
	We're doing our best to provide clear and reliable results as well as
	a good interface with the Markup Validator, but for some reason you
	may want to check other validators. Here are a few choices:
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li><a href="http://valet.webthing.com/page/">Page Valet</a>, part of the
	<a href="http://valet.webthing.com/">Site Valet</a> suite.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.htmlhelp.com/tools/validator/">WDG's HTML validator</a></li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	Looking for validators at W3C, but not the Markup Validator?
	Check out the list of <a href="http://www.w3.org/QA/Tools/#validators">validators at W3C</a>,
	including well-known <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">CSS validator</a>,
	<a href="http://validator.w3.org/checklink">link checker</a>, etc.
	</p>
	

      <h3 id="how">How does The Validator work?</h3>
      <p>
	The Validator is based on <a href="http://www.jclark.com/">James
        Clark</a>'s <code><a href="http://www.jclark.com/sp/">nsgmls</a></code>
        SGML parser. The Validator itself is a CGI script that fetches your
        URL, passes it through <code>nsgmls</code>, and post-processes the
        resulting error list for easier reading. 
      </p>

<h2 id="using">Using this service</h2>

      <h3 id="manual">How do I use this service?</h3>
      <p>
	Most probably, you will want to use the online Markup Validation service.
	Read the <a href="users.html">user's manual</a> for further help with this
	service.
      </p>
      </p>
	If, for some reason, you prefer running your own instance of the Markup Validator,
	check out our <a href="devel.html">developer's documentation</a>.
      </p>

      <h3 id="errors">What are these error messages?</h3>

      <h3 id="munged-doctype">Many error messages? Don't panic.</h3>
      <p>
        Don't panic. Did The Validator complain about your
        <code>DOCTYPE</code> declaration (or lack thereof)? Make sure your
        document has a syntactically correct <code>DOCTYPE</code>
        declaration, as described in the <a href="sgml.html#doctype">section
        on <code>DOCTYPE</code></a>, and make sure it correctly identifies
        the type of HTML you're using. Then run it through The Validator
        again; if you're lucky, you should get a lot fewer errors.
      </p>
      <p>
        If this doesn't help, then you may be experiencing a cascade failure
        &mdash; one error that gets The Validator so confused that it can't
        make sense of the rest of your page. Try correcting the first few
        errors and running your page through The Validator again. 
      </p>
      <p>
	Be patient, with a little time and experience you will learn to use the 
	Markup Validator to clean up your HTML documents in no time.
      </p>

      <h3 id="cleanup">I don't want error messages, I want you to clean up my page!</h3>
       <p>The Markup Validator can not do this for you. You may want to have a look
	at tools such as <a href="http://tidy.sourceforge.net">HTML Tidy</a>.</p>
