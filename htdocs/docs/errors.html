      <dl>
        <dt id="undef-id"><code>ID "<var>FOO</var>" already defined</code></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            You have defined the id/name "<var>FOO</var>" more
            then once. You will also get a message telling you where it was
            first defined. Be aware that this message may be the result of an
            ambiguity in the specification. While user-agents must treat
            values of the id attribute as case-sensitive, they must still be
            case-insensitive unique in the document. See
            <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/links.html#h-12.2.1">Section
            12.2.1 Syntax of anchor names</a> in the HTML 4.01 Recommendation
            for further information.

        </dd>
        <dt id="unterm-comment-1"><code>entity end not allowed in comment</code></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            Unterminated comment. The position indicator points to the very end of
            the file, where the problem was detected; to find the beginning of the
            comment, try searching for the last occurrence of
            `<code>&lt;!--</code>' in the document.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt id="unterm-comment-2"><code>name start character invalid: only s and comment allowed in comment declaration</code></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            Unterminated comments again. This time, you have a case like:
          </p>
          <pre>
            &lt;!-- This is the first unterminated comment &gt;
            &lt;!-- This is the second one &gt;
          </pre>
          <p>
            The validator (correctly) interprets the `<code>--</code>' in the
            second comment as terminating the first comment, and then interprets
            the text of the second comment as text between comments, which is not
            allowed.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt id="bad-comment"><code>unknown declaration type "<var>FOO</var>"</code></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            Most likely an invalid comment of the form
            <code>&lt;!invalid comment&gt;</code>; the validator is (correctly)
            attempting to interpret it as an <a href="sgml.html#sgml">SGML</a>
            markup declaration.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt id="attr-quoted"><code>an attribute value must be a literal unless it contains only name characters</code></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            You have an attribute whose value needs to be in quotes. If an
            attribute value contains any character other than letters, digits,
            hyphens and periods, it must be enclosed in double quotes (single
            quotes would also be OK from an <a href="sgml.html#sgml">SGML</a>
            standpoint, but some browsers don't recognize them).
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt id="attr-char"><code>character "X" not allowed in attribute specification list</code></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            The validator has found a character inside an HTML tag that isn't
            allowed there. This usually means you didn't put an attribute value in
            quotes when necessary. It also probably means that the character in
            question is not allowed in the value of the attribute at all, or you
            would have received the <a href="#attr-quoted">previous error</a>
            instead. See <a href="#bad-attr-char">below</a> for more information.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also get in trouble by forgetting the closing quote on an
            attribute. For instance:
          </p>
          <pre>
            &lt;IMG SRC="http://foo.com/fred.gif&gt;
            &lt;IMG SRC="http://foo.com/joe.gif&gt;
          </pre>
          <p>
            The validator will (correctly) interpret this as a SRC value of
            <code>"http://foo.com/fred.gif&gt; &lt;IMG SRC="</code>, and then
            choke on the following `:'. In this case, the position indicator in
            the error message may be several lines below the line with the missing
            quote.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt id="name-length"><code>length of attribute value must not exceed LITLEN less NORMSEP (1022)</code></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            This usually occurs in conjunction with the
            <a href="#attr-char">previous error</a>. It almost always means that
            you've forgotten a closing quote on an attribute value. For instance,
            in:
          </p>
          <pre>
            &lt;IMG SRC="fred.gif&gt;
            &lt;!-- 50 lines of stuff --&gt;
            &lt;IMG SRC="joe.gif"&gt;
          </pre>
          <p>
            The SRC value for the first <code>&lt;IMG&gt;</code> is the entire
            fifty lines of stuff up to the next double quote, which probably
            exceeds the <a href="sgml.html#sgml">SGML</a>-defined length limit for
            HTML string literals. Note that the position indicator in the error
            message points to where the attribute value <em>ended</em> &mdash; in
            this case, the <code>"joe.gif"</code> line.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt id="undef-tag"><code>element "<var>FOO</var>" undefined</code></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            You've used an unknown tag (represented here by "<var>FOO</var>"). Make sure the
            DTD indicated by your DOCTYPE actually includes this element.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the tag in question is a frame-related tag you must use the
            "Frameset" DTD, and if you use (deprecated) physical markup ("FONT"
            and friends) you must use the "Transitional" DTD.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt id="not-allowed"><code>document type does not allow element "<var>FOO</var>" here</code></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            Straightforward, but not terribly informative. There are a
            <em>lot</em> of different errors that will generate this error
            message:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Using an unknown tag. In this case, the next error will be
              <a href="#undef-tag">element "<var>FOO</var>" undefined"</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Using a tag in the wrong place. For instance,
              <code>&lt;TABLE&gt;&lt;TD&gt;blah&lt;/TABLE&gt;</code> will cause
              this error. The trick here is that <code>&lt;TABLE&gt;</code> cannot
              <em>directly</em> contain <code>&lt;TD&gt;</code>'s; it contains
              <code>&lt;TR&gt;</code>'s which contain <code>&lt;TD&gt;</code>'s.
              The above example should be
              <code>&lt;TABLE&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;blah&lt;/TABLE&gt;</code>.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt><a id="not-contained" name="not-contained">document type does not allow element "<var>FOO</var>" here; assuming missing "<var>BAR</var>" start-tag</a>"</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            Similar to the <a href="#not-allowed">previous error</a>, but more
            specific: in this case, you have a "<var>FOO</var>" element that is not contained
            in a "<var>BAR</var>" element when "<var>FOO</var>" is not allowed outside of "<var>BAR</var>". Some of the
            most common causes of this error are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Using the <code>DD</code> element as a fake paragraph indent.
              <code>DD</code> is not allowed outside of a <code>DL</code> element.
            </li>
            <li>
              Improper construction of a nested list. An inner UL or OL in a
              nested list may not appear directly within an outer UL/OL, but only
              within an LI of the outer UL/OL, as in the following example:
              <pre>
          &lt;OL&gt;
            &lt;LI&gt;Obtain the following items:
              &lt;UL&gt;
                &lt;LI&gt;Ham&lt;/LI&gt;
                &lt;LI&gt;Bread; one of:
                  &lt;UL&gt;
                    &lt;LI&gt;White&lt;/LI&gt;
                    &lt;LI&gt;Rye&lt;/LI&gt;
                    &lt;LI&gt;Whole wheat&lt;/LI&gt;
                  &lt;/UL&gt;
                &lt;/LI&gt;  &lt;!-- End of the "Bread" &lt;LI&gt; --&gt;
                &lt;LI&gt;Cheese&lt;/LI&gt;
              &lt;/UL&gt;
            &lt;/LI&gt;  &lt;!-- End of the "Obtain" &lt;LI&gt; --&gt;
            &lt;LI&gt;Place ham and cheese between two slices of bread&lt;/LI&gt;
            &lt;LI&gt;Consume the resulting ham-and-cheese sandwich&lt;/LI&gt;
          &lt;/OL&gt;
              </pre>
              <p>
                The <code>&lt;/LI&gt;</code> end tags are optional and are only
                included above to emphasize how the structure of the nested list
                is arranged; if you omit them, the parser will infer their
                presence in the locations shown above. 
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The validator has inserted a "<var>BAR</var>" start tag where it thinks there needs
            to be one; it will probably complain later on that <a href="#no-end-tag">the
            corresponding end tag is also missing</a>.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt id="attr-undef"><code>there is no attribute "<var>FOO</var>" for this element (in this HTML version)</code></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            You have used an attribute with an element that is defined not to have
            that attribute. This is most commonly caused by using
            vendor-specific attributes without setting the document type
            appropriately.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt id="undef-attr-val"><code>"<var>FOO</var>" is not a member of the group specified in the declared value of this attribute</code></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            Similar to the <a href="#attr-undef">previous error</a>; this time,
            you're using an attribute that is defined for the element, but with a
            value that isn't defined for the attribute. For instance, the Netscape
            extension <code>&lt;IMG ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE&gt;</code> will cause this
            error; ABSMIDDLE isn't one of the allowed values for the ALIGN
            attribute of <code>&lt;IMG&gt;</code> (unless, of course, you provided
            a Netscape document type).
          </p>
          <p>
            If you're using the Netscape document type, the BORDER attribute of
            <code>&lt;TABLE&gt;</code> can cause this error.
          </p>
          <p>
            This error can also be caused, oddly enough, by missing close quotes
            on attribute values. For instance, given:
          </p>
          <pre>
            &lt;IMG SRC="fred.gif&gt; &lt;IMG SRC="joe.gif&gt;
          </pre>
          <p>
            The validator will (correctly) see a SRC attribute of
            <code>"fred.gif&gt; &lt;IMG SRC="</code>, and then try to interpret
            JOE.GIF as an attribute of <code>&lt;IMG&gt;</code>.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt id="bad-attr-char"><code>syntax of attribute value does not conform to declared value</code></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            Yet another attribute error; this time, the attribute in question was
            defined to take a numeric value, or an <a
            href="sgml.html#sgml">SGML</a> identifier value, and you used a
            character that doesn't match what it was expecting.
          </p>
          <p>
            One potentially annoying source of this error is the
            <code>TD WIDTH</code> attribute. Whether intentionally or by oversight,
            the HTML 3.2 DTD defines this attribute to have a value type of NUMBER,
            which means that <code>&lt;TD WIDTH="50%"&gt;</code> is not allowed.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt id="attr-bad-name"><code>value of attribute "<var>FOO</var>" invalid: "#" cannot start a name</code></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            A special case of <a href="#bad-attr-char">the previous error</a>; the
            attribute in question is defined to take as value an SGML name token,
            which must begin with a letter.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt id="bad-abbrev-attr"><code>"<var>FOO</var>" is not a member of a group specified for any attribute</code></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            Another attribute error, this time referring to an "abbreviated"
            attribute. <a href="sgml.html#sgml">SGML</a> allows you to omit the
            name of an attribute if the attribute value is unambiguous. For
            instance, <code>&lt;IMG ISMAP&gt;</code> is actually an abbreviation
            of <code>&lt;IMG ISMAP=ISMAP&gt;</code>. (Technically, this also means
            that e.g. <code>&lt;P ALIGN=CENTER&gt;</code> could be abbreviated to
            <code>&lt;P CENTER&gt;</code>, but it is unlikely that current
            browsers will get this right.) The validator has found something that
            looks like an abbreviated attribute but doesn't match the value of any
            attribute for this element. For instance, a typo like
            <code>&lt;IMG ISNAP&gt;</code> would produce this error.
          </p>
          <p>
            A missing close quote on a previous attribute value can also trigger
            this error if the next quote it finds is followed by something that
            looks like an abbreviated attribute; for instance,
            <code>&lt;IMG SRC="fred.gif&gt;&lt;IMG SRC="joe.gif&gt;</code> would
            produce this error, referring to the "attribute value" <code>JOE.GIF</code>.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt id="attr-missing"><code>required attribute "<var>FOO</var>" not specified</code></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            You left off a required attribute of the indicated element. The most
            common such omitted attribute is the <code>ALT</code> attribute of the
            <code>AREA</code> or <code>IMG</code> element; browsers will typically
            use these to build a menu equivalent to your client-side image map if

        <dt id="no-end-tag"><code>end tag for "<var>FOO</var>" omitted, but its declaration does not permit this</code></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            You forgot to close something. "<var>FOO</var>" is the element you forgot to close
            (and the next message, `start tag was here' points to the particular
            instance of "<var>FOO</var>" in question); the positional indicator points to where
            the validator expected you to close the element. There are a few
            common ways that this can happen:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You've put something inside the "<var>FOO</var>" element that isn't allowed
              there. For instance,
              <code>&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;H4&gt;fake font change&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;</code>
              will cause this error, since headers aren't allowed inside <code>&lt;UL&gt;</code>'s; the
              validator assumes that you meant to close the
              <code>&lt;UL&gt;</code> before opening the <code>&lt;H4&gt;</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Interlocked elements. For instance,
              <code>&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;nope&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;</code> will cause
              this error. HTML requires that you close elements inside-out
              &mdash; that is, the last element you opened is the first element you should
              close. In this example, you'd have to close the
              <code>&lt;I&gt;</code> before the <code>&lt;B&gt;</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Unclosed <code>&lt;A&gt;</code> tags. Yes, even
              <code>&lt;A NAME="foo"&gt;</code> has to have a corresponding
              <code>&lt;/A&gt;</code>. Note that an empty
              <code>&lt;A NAME&gt;</code> element won't be recognized by some browsers; be
              sure to put at least a word or two inside the
              <code>&lt;A&gt;</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Having unadorned text where the validator was expecting a
              sub-element of "<var>FOO</var>". For instance,
              <code>&lt;DL&gt;fake indent&lt;/DL&gt;</code> will produce this error,
              since inside a
              <code>&lt;DL&gt;</code>, the validator only expects to see
              <code>&lt;DT&gt;</code>'s and <code>&lt;DD&gt;</code>'s.
            </li>
            <li>
              A tag of the form <code>&lt;TABLE WIDTH=100%&gt;</code>. The
              previous error should have been that the `%' was <a
              href="#attr-char">"not allowed in attribute specification list"</a>.
              What's happening here is that, in trying to get past the `%', the
              validator has become confused and thinks the `%' is <em>inside</em>
              the <code>&lt;TABLE&gt;...&lt;/TABLE&gt;</code>, thus triggering the
              error message for the previous reason. This error will likely be
              followed by mistaken complaints that your <code>&lt;TR&gt;</code>'s
              are <a href="#not-allowed">"not allowed here"</a>, plus a complaint
              about your <code>&lt;/TABLE&gt;</code> end tag. The solution is to
              put the attribute value in quotes; ie. <code>&lt;TABLE
              WIDTH="100%"&gt;</code>.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In general, you should always explicitly close all elements and
            quote all attribute values.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt id="floating-close"><code>end tag for element "<var>FOO</var>" which is not open</code></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            The validator found an end tag, represented here by "<var>FOO</var>", without a
            corresponding start tag. This frequently occurs in conjunction with
            the <a href="#no-end-tag">previous error</a>. For instance, given
            <code>&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;nope&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;</code>, the validator
            will insert a <code>&lt;/I&gt;</code> before the
            <code>&lt;/B&gt;</code>, and then will find the
            <code>&lt;/I&gt;</code> after the <code>&lt;/B&gt;</code> and will
            have nothing to match it with.
          </p>
          <p>
            A subtle variation of this is <code>&lt;P&gt;&lt;H4&gt;fake font
            change&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</code>. <code>&lt;H4&gt;</code>'s aren't
            allowed inside <code>&lt;P&gt;</code>'s, but since HTML allows you to
            omit the <code>&lt;/P&gt;</code> end tag for paragraphs, the validator
            assumes that you meant <code>&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4&gt;fake font
            change&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</code>, in which case the final
            <code>&lt;/P&gt;</code> is indeed superfluous.
          </p>
          <p>
            This error can also be caused by incorrectly supplying an end tag for
            "empty" elements like <code>&lt;HR&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;BR&gt;</code>
            or <code>&lt;IMG&gt;</code>.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt id="omitted-content"><code>end tag for "<var>FOO</var>" which is not finished</code></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            You have a "<var>FOO</var>" element, but you have omitted some required sub-element
            of it. For instance, a <code>TABLE</code> with no <code>TR</code>'s
            would cause this error.
          </p>

        <dt id="no-start-tag"><code>start tag for "<var>FOO</var>" omitted, but its declaration does not permit this</code></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            The validator expected you to start a "<var>FOO</var>" element at the indicated
            point. This probably means you've put unadorned text somewhere it
            isn't allowed; for instance, <code>&lt;UL&gt;fake
            indent&lt;/UL&gt;</code> will cause this error.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt id="bad-entity"><code>unknown entity "<var>FOO</var>"</code></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            The validator has found an entity (something like
            <code>&amp;this;</code>) that it doesn't recognize. There are a few
            possibilities:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                A reference to a URI that uses <code>&amp;</code> as a separator
                between parameters, such as
                "<code>http://example.org/prog?x=1&amp;y=2</code>".
              </p>
              <p>
                To solve this problem, simply replace all the <code>&amp;</code>'s
                in attribute values with <code>&amp;amp;</code> (user agents will
                convert them back before following the links.)
              </p>
              <p>
                Another way to get around this problem is for the author of the CGI
                program to allow a different value to be used between arguments,
                like ';' or '|', which would allow the link to be coded as e.g.
                <code>&lt;a href="http://example.org/prog?x=1;y=2"&gt;</code>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              An unterminated entity; for instance, <code>this&amp;ampthat</code>
              for "this&amp;that", which the validator (correctly) interprets as a
              request for the entity <code>&amp;ampthat;</code>. Technically, any
              non-alphanumeric character (such as a space) will suffice to
              terminate the entity, but some browsers get this wrong; the safest
              thing to do is to terminate all entities with a semicolon, turning
              our example into <code>this&amp;amp;that</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              The entity <code>&amp;quot;</code> in conjunction with the HTML 3.2
              <code>DOCTYPE</code>. This entity was <a
              href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-html/1997Mar/0003.html">accidentally
              omitted</a> from the most recent version of the HTML 3.2 DTD. You
              should be able to ignore this error safely, though if you wish, you
              can replace <code>&amp;quot;</code> with the equivalent character
              entity <code>&amp;#34;</code>.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt id="bad-char"><code>non SGML character number ###</code></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            You've used an illegal character in your text. HTML uses the standard
            ISO8859-1 character encoding, and ISO8859-1 leaves undefined 65
            character codes (0 to 31 inclusive and 127 to 159 inclusive); the
            validator has found one of these undefined characters in your
            document. The character may appear on your browser as a curly quote,
            or a trademark symbol, or some other fancy glyph; on a different
            computer, however, it will likely appear as a completely different
            character, or nothing at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your best bet is to replace the character with the nearest equivalent
            ASCII character, or to use an appropriate <a
            href="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/html3/latin1.html">character
            entity</a>. For more information on ISO8859-1, see <a

            This error can also be triggered by formatting characters embedded in
            documents by some word processors. If you use a word processor to edit
            your HTML documents, be sure to use the "Save as ASCII" or similar
            command to save the document without formatting information.
