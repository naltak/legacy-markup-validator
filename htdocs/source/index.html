<h1>W3C HTML Validation Service: Source Code</h1>

<p>
  The source code for the <a
  href="../">W3C HTML Validation Service</a> is available under the terms
  of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-software">W3C
  Software Copyright</a>.
</p>

<p>
  You can retrieve the code a number of ways:
</p>

<ul>

  <li><p>If you intend to actively mirror the code or and/or contribute
  patches to the code, you should install and become familiar with <a
  href="http://www.cyclic.com/cvs/info.html">CVS</a>; this is the
  tool we use for revision control (it is also used by the <a
  href="http://dev.apache.org/">Apache</a> and <a
  href="http://www.mozilla.org/cvs.html">Mozilla</a> developers,
  and is generally a good thing to get to know.) <a
  href="http://www.loria.fr/~molli/cvs-index.html">More information
  on CVS</a> is available courtesy of <a
  href="http://www.loria.fr/~molli/">Pascal Molli</a>.</p>

  <p>
  Our CVS base is available read-only, using the CVS pserver authentification: 

  <blockquote><code>
  CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@dev.w3.org:/sources/public
  </code></blockquote>

  <blockquote><code>
  password: anonymous
  </code></blockquote>

  <li>If you just want to glance at the code, or see its revision
  history, you can <a
  href="http://dev.w3.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/validator/">browse it on the web</a>.

  <p>
  The most interesting files are currently <a
  href="http://dev.w3.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/validator/httpd/cgi-bin/check">a
  CGI script called "check"</a> that does pretty much everything,
  and possibly also <a
  href="http://dev.w3.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/validator/httpd/conf/httpd.conf">the
  httpd.conf</a>. (select the topmost revision numbers on these pages to see
  the most recent revision of each file.)
  </p>

</ul>

<p>
  The purpose of making the source code available is partly to allow
  others to set up mirrors of the service (either publicly or within
  an intranet behind a firewall), but also to allow us to collaborate
  on making the service better -- there are <a
  href="/todo.html">many ways the service could be improved</a> but I
  only have a small amount of time to work on it myself.
</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>
  Before you will be able to get the code to run, you will need a few
  things already installed on your system:
</p>

<ul>

  <li>A Unix-like operating system. It may work with Windows NT or
  other systems, but I haven't tried it yet. It has worked on Linux,
  Solaris, FreeBSD, and Digital UNIX. If anyone tries it on other
  systems and gets it to work, please <a href="/feedback.html">let
  me know</a> (and <a href="/feedback.html">send me patches</a>, if
  they are needed to get it to work eleswhere.)

  <li><a href="http://www.jclark.com/sp/">SP version 1.2.1 or higher</a>.
  SP is the SGML parser used by the service. More recent versions than
  1.2.1 will likely work, but I haven't tried them yet. Patches will
  likely be necessary if the output format has changed even slightly
  since version 1.2.1.

  <li><a
  href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/websoft/libwww-perl/">libwww-perl4</a>:
  this is a perl library I use to retrieve documents from other Web sites
  before validating them. I hacked this slightly before using it in the
  validation service; I would really like to replace this with the more
  modern <a href="http://www.linpro.no/lwp/">LWP module for Perl5</a>;
  if anyone can do this and <a
  href="/feedback.html">supply patches</a>, I would be very grateful!
  
  <li>A web server: I am currently running <a
  href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a> version 1.3.1, but likely any
  version will work, and other httpd's may work as well.

  <li><a href="http://www.perl.com/">Perl</a>: the <a
  href="http://dev.w3.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/validator/httpd/cgi-bin/check">main
  CGI script</a> that does everything is written in Perl; as far as
  I know it will work with Perl 4 since my knowledge of Perl is currently
  circa 1994, but you should really be using Perl 5. (My version of Perl
  is 5.004_04 or higher.)

</ul>

<p>
  If anyone tries to use the code, and succeeds (or fails), please <a
  href="/feedback.html">let me know</a>!
