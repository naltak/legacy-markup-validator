<h1>W3C HTML Validation Service: Source Code</h1>

<p>
  The source code for the <a
  href="../">W3C HTML Validation Service</a> is available under the terms
  of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-software">W3C
  Software Copyright</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The purpose of making the source code available is partly to allow
  others to set up mirrors of the service (either publicly or within
  an intranet behind a firewall), but also to allow us to collaborate
  on making the service better -- there are <a
  href="/todo.html">many ways the service could be improved</a> but I
  only have a small amount of time to work on it myself.
</p>

<p>
  You can retrieve the code a number of ways:
</p>

<ul>

  <li>If you just want to glance at the code, or see its revision
  history, you can <a
  href="http://dev.w3.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/validator/">browse it on the web</a>.

  <p>
  The most interesting files are currently <a
  href="http://dev.w3.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/validator/httpd/cgi-bin/check">a
  CGI script called "check"</a> that does pretty much everything,
  and possibly also <a
  href="http://dev.w3.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/validator/httpd/conf/httpd.conf">the
  httpd.conf</a>. (select the topmost revision numbers on these pages to see
  the most recent revision of each file.)
  </p>

  <li><p>If you want a copy of all the files that make up the
  service, you can <a href="../validator.tar.gz">grab a tar
  ball</a> (~1.5M, updated every day at 06:00 ET.)
  </p>

  <li><p><a name="CVS">If you intend to actively mirror the code</a>
  and/or contribute
  patches to the code, you should install and become familiar with <a
  href="http://www.cyclic.com/cvs/info.html">CVS</a>; this is the
  tool we use for revision control (it is also used by the <a
  href="http://dev.apache.org/">Apache</a> and <a
  href="http://www.mozilla.org/cvs.html">Mozilla</a> developers,
  and is generally a good thing to get to know.) <a
  href="http://www.loria.fr/~molli/cvs-index.html">More information
  on CVS</a> is available courtesy of <a
  href="http://www.loria.fr/~molli/">Pascal Molli</a>.</p>

  <p>
  Our CVS base is available read-only, using CVS pserver authentication
  a la:

  <blockquote><samp>
    bash$ <kbd><b>export
      CVSROOT=":pserver:anonymous@dev.w3.org:/sources/public"</b></kbd><br>
    bash$ <kbd><b>cvs login</b></kbd><br>
    (Logging in to anonymous@dev.w3.org)<br>
    CVS password: <kbd><b>anonymous</b></kbd><br>
    bash$ <kbd><b>cvs get validator</b></kbd><br>
    cvs server: Updating validator<br>
    cvs server: Updating validator/htdocs<br>
    U validator/htdocs/about.html<br>
    ...
  </samp></blockquote>

   goofy, and having that text boldfaced is ever so much clearer. - Gerald

</ul>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>
  Before you will be able to get the code to run, you will need a few
  things already installed on your system:
</p>

<ul>

  <li>A Unix-like operating system. It may work with Windows NT or
  other systems, but I haven't tried it yet. It has worked on Linux,
  Solaris, FreeBSD, and Digital UNIX. If anyone tries it on other
  systems and gets it to work, please <a href="/feedback.html">let
  me know</a> (and <a href="/feedback.html">send me patches</a>, if
  they are needed to get it to work eleswhere.)

  <li><a href="http://www.jclark.com/sp/">SP version 1.2.1 or higher</a>.
  SP is the SGML parser used by the service. More recent versions than
  1.2.1 will also work; I am currently using version 1.3.

  <li><a href="/sgml-lib.tar.gz">A collection of DTDs and other SGML
  files</a> to validate against. You don't strictly <em>need</em> these
  on your system since SP will retrieve them off the Web if you use URIs
  in your doctypes, but you probably want them locally for efficiency.
  (You don't need to download this tar ball if you mirror everything
  using <a href="#CVS">CVS</a>.)

  <li>The <a href="http://www.linpro.no/lwp/">LWP Perl module</a>
  
  <li>A web server: I am currently running <a
  href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a> version 1.3.6, but likely any
  version will work, and other httpd's may work as well.

  <li><a href="http://www.perl.com/">Perl</a>: the <a
  href="http://dev.w3.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/validator/httpd/cgi-bin/check">main
  CGI script</a> that does everything is written in Perl.

</ul>

<p>
  If anyone tries to use the code, and succeeds (or fails), please <a
  href="/feedback.html">let me know</a>!
